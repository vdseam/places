## Places

Places is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that demonstrates deep linking functionality with a modified version of the Wikipedia. It allows users to explore various locations and open them directly in the Wikipedia app's 'Places' tab.

> [!TIP] 
> It is meant to be used with a [modified version](https://github.com/vdseam/wikipedia-ios) of the Wikipedia iOS app. Please clone and build **both projects** on any convenient device or simulator before testing.
